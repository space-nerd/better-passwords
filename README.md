# Better-Passwords
This is an idea I had to to make the web a more secure place.
When you first reate an account for a website there will be a 6 digit code created.
Then individually on the server and client side the same password will be generated.
After every login a new password will be generated on both sides.
The user will not even have to input the password.
The password will be 1000 - 5000 characters in length.
